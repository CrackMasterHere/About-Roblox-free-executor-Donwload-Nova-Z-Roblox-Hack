Please make sure you have your antivirus turned off temporarily. (Real time scanning) Since this is a Roblox exploit, it gets falsely flagged as a virus due to the fact that it is an exploit. There are no real viruses in my exploit, so there is nothing to worry about. After you disable your antivirus, you need to have a folder ready, preferaby in your "Documents" folder. Please note that you cannot have any parent folders with spaces in the name, otherwise some settings won't work. I have no Idea why this is causing an issue, but that happened to me. I'm not really sure, but feel free to test it yourself. I will try to find a fix for it soon. Please view the below example if you didn't understand:
